# Hack the Opportunities
Never miss a deadline again!<br><br>
Can't keep track of the opportunities or you get to know about it when it's too late?
I too, had been struggling with constantly learning about new opportunities when someone posted about them on LinkedIn unfortunately way past the deadline :( <br><br>
So I decided to maintain a database of all the opportunities I came across and this repository is the result!
This list is not complete and I alone cannot make it whole. This is where the community efforts come and so I made the list open Source! <br>
